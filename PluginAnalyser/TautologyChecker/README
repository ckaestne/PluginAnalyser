This is a simple Tautology Checker for PluginAnalyser Dependency Reports

> a feature model from inter plugin dependencies has to be created, name it as dependencies.fm
> a constraints model with information on how each function invokation is satisfied, from importers to exporter sets need to be created, name it as constraints.fm

put both of them in the TautologyChecker HOME/fodder folder.

Run using sbt:

"sbt compile" gets all required dependencies, compiles the code,

"sbt run" gets all required dependencies, compiles the code, and runs it

"sbt mkrun" creates a shell script that you can use to run it from the command line
