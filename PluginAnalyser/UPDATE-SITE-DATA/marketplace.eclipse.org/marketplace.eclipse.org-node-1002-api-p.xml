      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>CloverETL Designer allows its users-developers to create and modify data transformations in graphical format.</p>
<p>CloverETL Designer is a Graphical User Interface for CloverETL Engine - tool designed for Data collection, Data transformation, Data integration, etc.</p>
<p>Such visual design essentially simplifies and streamlines the entire development process.</p>
<p>The developer selects from a pallete of existing components and pastes them onto a worksheet. Then he interconnects them into graphical representation of a transformation graph. The graphical representation is then translated by CloverETL Designer into XML self-documenting code, which is subsequently executed by CloverETL Engine. The XML code is platform-independent.</p>
