      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>Latest News: - Version 1.0 released (Only Word) - Improvements in Word and Presentation, New Browser Toolbar - WordArt basic Implementation- Improvements in Word, Textboxes - Browser released - Browser performance significantly increased - Password Management - XULRunner integrated - SWT- remote - Client integrated - Update integrated - Browser completed - Shapes completed - Integration with Inksapce - SVG Support - Images direct from Google Search - Printing implemented - Windows Installer available now. Excel Sheets can be edited, Most Office 2007 documents can be viewed and edited now.</p>
<p>J-Office for Java consists of different Java/SWT/Draw2d-Based components to view and edit OOXML (MS2007-Office) documents. There is no need to have any Office installed. Future releases will also support the ODF-Format (Open Office). A webbrowser is integrated for a better Interoperability with the Office programs.<br />
Though the main purpose is to provide a Java component that can be easily be integrated into existing Java application it can be also used in the future as an alternative to MS-Office. J-Office has no dependency to any installed Office suite.<br />
The actual size of the main component is about 1 MByte. The size of the final release will be kept far below 10 MByte, so it is also an option for small devices.</p>
<p>Since J-Office for Java is based on Apache POI, documents can easily be manipulated. Integration with existing Eclipse plugins is possible. Examples are included. A free demo can be downloaded via Java Webstart.<br />
The viewer components will be available for productive use by end of march 2010. It is planned to cover 80 % of the OOXML-Ecma standard at the first release (1.0).<br />
The editors will be released by end of 2010.</p>
