      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>The COBOL CloneDR identifies and displays code segments within a system that are identical or nearly identical (clones), supporting the consolidation of clones to reduce the size and increase the clarity and reliability of the source code.</p>
<p>COBOL CloneDR Features</p>
<p>Dialects: ANSI COBOL85, IBM VS COBOL II, IBM Enterprise, AS400. Other dialects can be accommodated.<br />
Runs under Windows, not requiring mainframe execution platform<br />
Works with arbitrary subsets of source code base<br />
Can handles thousands of source files<br />
Handles COPY and REPLACE preprocessor directives<br />
Analysis can be parameterized by clone similarity threshold, clone size, maximum number of clone parameters, and other limits, allowing tailored use<br />
Report characterizes each clone tuple by mass, number of instances, number of parameters, similarity ratio, language syntax category, length, and location, with each instance pictured<br />
Produces a summary report in HTML including statistics sorted by various attributes and with links to HTML pages describing individual clones like this.<br />
You can see a complete Clone Detection Report for a COBOL source code base of 77,000 lines that has 58% redundancy.</p>
<p>Eclipse/RDz COBOL CloneDR User Interface</p>
<p>For installations using the Rational Development for System Z (RDz) Environment, the CloneDR tool has an RDz-based, interactive GUI that supports:</p>
<p>Browsing of diagnostic results in an expandable tree view<br />
Tree view diagnostics linked and integrated with an LPEX COBOL editor<br />
Visual display of selected clone tuples in source code with parameter fragments (differences) listed in tree view and highlighted in editor<br />
Direct access to statistical summaries</p>
