      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>RMBench Relational Modeller is designed to be a one-stop Eclipse-integrated solution for grapically modelling relational databases. Databases can be reverse-engineered via JDBC, SQL can be generated from the model and executed directly from within the workbench.</p>
<p>Among the many unique features is the ability to compare a model against an existing database and view the changes in a structure view and as ALTER statements simultaneously. A model can also be exported to a HTML/Javascript site.</p>
<p>RMBench has recently been released under EPL and is now free for any kind of use</p>
