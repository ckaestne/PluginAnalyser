      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>The comprehensive test of modern communication systems leads to large and complex test suites which have to be maintained throughout the system life-cycle. Experience with those written in the standardised Testing and Test Control Notation (TTCN-3) has shown that the maintenance of test suites is a non-trivial task and its burden can be reduced with appropriate tool support. To this aim, we have developed the TRex tool, published as open-source Eclipse plugin under the Eclipse Public License, which provides IDE functionality for the TTCN-3 core notation and supports the assessment and automatic restructuring of TTCN-3 test suites by providing suitable metrics and refactorings.</p>
