<p>GWT Designer is a powerful and easy to use bi-directional GUI creator that supports the Google Web Toolkit (GWT). With GWT Designer, you can use the visual designer and Java code will be generated for you. You can easily add controls using drag-and-drop, add event handlers to your controls, change various properties of controls using a property editor and much more. You have complete freedom to change and refactor its generated code and see your changes immediately reflected in the visual designer. GWT Designer's powerful parser can also reverse engineer code created by hand.</p>
<table style="WIDTH: 100%; BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse"><tbody><tr><td>
<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">GWT Designer is built as a plug-in to Eclipse, JBuilder MyEclipse and Rational IDEs. The plug-in builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to navigate the source code and uses GEF to display and manage the visual presentation. Using WYSIWYG layout tools, you don't need to write any lines of Java code - the designer will generate the code for you.</span></span>

</tr></tbody></table><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Generated code doesn't require any additional custom libraries to compile and run beyond GWT itself: all of the generated code can be used without having GWT Designer installed.

It also supports free form code editing (make changes anywhere, not just in special areas) and most user refactorings (you can move, rename and subdivide methods without a problem).</span> </p>
