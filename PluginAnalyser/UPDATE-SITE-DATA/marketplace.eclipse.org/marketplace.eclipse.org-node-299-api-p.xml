      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>SmartInspect is an advanced logging tool for debugging and monitoring .NET, Java and Delphi applications. It helps you to identify bugs, find solutions to customer problems and gives you a clear understanding of how your software works in different environments and under different circumstances.</p>
<p>SmartInspect assists you even where regular debuggers fail: It is possible to easily debug distributed systems, multi-threaded applications, software on production systems and inspect software that runs at your customer's place.</p>
<p>Please note that SmartInspect currently does not offer an actual Eclipse plugin, but the SmartInspect setup generates library files for easy integration with the Eclipse IDE.</p>
