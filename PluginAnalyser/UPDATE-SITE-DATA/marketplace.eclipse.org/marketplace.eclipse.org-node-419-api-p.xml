      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>The <em>Relations</em> application is a tool for knowledge management. It is a combination of a personal Wiki and an electronic slip box.</p>
<p>You can easily create items of three types (<em>terms</em>, <em>texts</em> and <em>persons</em>) and set them in relation to other items already entered, thus creating a rich context for your items.</p>
<p>Relations is a <em>Rich Client Platform (RCP)</em> application based on the Eclipse platform.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul class="disc"><li>Content is stored using three types of items: term items, text items and person items.</li>
<li>The Relations application stores the content in a Derby database included in the out-of-the-box installation. A MySQL connector is included for that a MySQL database can be used as data store. The application can easily be extended to connect to other relational databases for storing the application's content.</li>
<li>Full text search implemented using Lucene.</li>
<li>Easy text formatting: text can be written <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic </em>or underlined, lists can be unordered (bullet list) or ordered (numerical or with uppercase and lowercase letters respectively).</li>
<li>Easy bookmarking of items possible.</li>
<li>Content can be printed out to a text file or an <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_self">OpenOffice.org</a> document.</li>
<li>Content stored in text items can be exported to a BibTEX file.</li>
<li>The content can be exported to an XML file and imported to another Relations database.</li>
<li>The content stored in the internal Derby database can be backuped. The<br />
backup copy of the content can be used to restore the content state or<br />
to import the content into another database catalog (of the same<br />
Relations application or a Relations application installed on a<br />
different computer).</li>
<li>The application contains a complete set of key bindings, therefore, the application can be fully controlled using the keyboard.</li>
<li>Content stored in text items can be formatted and exported as bibliographical lists. The bibliographical formatting is extensible and additional bibliographical formattings can easily be implemented.</li>
<li>The Relations user interface is available in english and german. </li>
