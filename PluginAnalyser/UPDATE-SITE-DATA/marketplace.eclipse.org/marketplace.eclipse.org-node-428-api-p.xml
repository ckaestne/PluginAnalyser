      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>A query language for browsing. You query your database-- why don't you query your code? Write queries to provide custom views of your code base.</p>
<p>The key concept is a query language for finding things in your code. Like a conventional browser in an IDE, the query language knows your code and your programming language; unlike a conventional browser, there is no limit to how deeply among the web of relationships among your program objects you can search in a single query. Although browsers may be sufficient for most of the searches a programmer might want to do, sometimes what your looking for is more complex. Programmers are used to thinking in terms of language and expressions; the query language lets them formulate arbitrarily complex questions about their code and see the answer almost instantly.</p>
