      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>The license management solution lets vendors of Eclipse-based software products, such as Eclipse plug-in's, easily integrate license management into their products, i.e. checks whether given Eclipse installation has a valid license for a particular product feature.</p>
<p>The solution consists of two closely integrated parts:<br />
  * License management/validation plug-in. Software vendors integrate this plug-in into their products to perform check which features are licensed in a given Eclipse installation. Users of vendor products use the preference page provided by the plug-in to install and view licenses and keys.<br />
  * License generation/delivery service provided by Hammurapi Group to vendors of Eclipse-based products.</p>
<p>Key features:<br />
    * License generation and delivery to customers.<br />
    * Payment processing.<br />
    * Licenses are encrypted with asymmetric encryption and cannot be forged.<br />
    * License management plug-in code is signed.<br />
    * Vendor plug-in code can implement additional integrity check of the licensing plug-in.<br />
    * Licenses can have expiration date or expiration period after first use of licensed feature.<br />
    * Clock-reset resilience - the solution detects when the system clock was rewound to continue to use licensed feature after expiration date.<br />
    * Fine-grained licensing - vendor product checks licensing at “feature” level, each license can contain multiple licensed features.</p>
