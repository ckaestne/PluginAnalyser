      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>Remote Agents enhance the build to release processes by allowing tasks to be distributed across multiple machines and operating systems.   Remote Agents can be used to support production deployment and distributed processing on multiple platforms. Remote Agents are available for OpenMake Meister and OpenMake Professional/Enterprise.</p>
<p>A distributed build is one in which individual steps in the Build Process are sent to be executed on multiple machines.  In doing this you are able to leverage more machine power instead of attempting to run the entire workload on a single machine.  Remote Agents extend both OpenMake Meister and OpenMake Mojo to support distributed execution of Build Tasks in your workflow.  </p>
<p>Remote Agents can be used to execute processes running on different operating systems. This allows you to execute a Process that builds the application across multiple platforms or to build specific components of the application on a specific Remote Agent.  For example, a Build Process that needs to build Windows .NET components as well as AIX Oracle back-end components would use two Remote Agents one for Windows and one for AIX.</p>
<p>Remote Agents can also be used as 'dedicated build machines.'  A dedicated “Build Machine” is often bigger and faster than a regular desktop machine.  The dedicated build machine would be configured as a Remote Agent in which the Build Process could be executed in a secured or "glass house" environment.  In addition, if you are using Meister's Build Automation, a dedicated machine with multi-processing power can be used to manage the calls to the compilers and linkers and accelerate the building of C and Java applications.</p>
