      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>The Whole Platform is a technology for engineering the production of software. </p>
<p>We think that programming is an activity concerning the development of domain languages; so, we provide a Language Workbench for developing new languages, manipulating them using domain notations and transforming them using a generative model driven approach.<br />
Using the Whole Platform, the problem domain experts can work together with the programming experts for the development of software products. </p>
<p>The languages boundled with the Whole Platform include:<br />
- modeling languages;<br />
- query and transformation languages;<br />
- integration languages for grammars, XSD, RDB and Java libraries;<br />
and popular languages such as Java, Objective C and XML. </p>
<p>The Whole Platform makes the transition smoother for the developers who prefer to code the domain knowledge as libraries instead of domain specific languages.<br />
The Platform, in fact, includes both an Eclipse based Language Workbench and a Java based Language Library. All the expressive power of domain languages is also available in their Java coded counterpart generated on top of our Language Framework.<br />
Furthermore the Whole Platform is written with extensive use of well-known Design Patterns.</p>
