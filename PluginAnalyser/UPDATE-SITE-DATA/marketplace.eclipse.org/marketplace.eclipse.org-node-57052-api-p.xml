      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>Sureassert UC is a free integrated Java unit testing solution for Eclipse.  It presents a simple, quick approach to testing method contracts and offers many innovative features.</p>
<!--break--><p>Sureassert UC for Eclipse offers:</p>
<ul><li><strong><a title="Exemplars" href="http://www.sureassert.com/uc/features/use-cases/">Exemplars</a></strong> – <em>declarative automatic code contract enforcement without test code</em></li>
<li><strong><a title="Automatic Continuous Testing" href="http://www.sureassert.com/uc/features/automatic-continuous-testing/">Automatic Continuous Testing</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Real-Time Continuous Test Coverage Reporting" href="http://www.sureassert.com/uc/features/real-time-continuous-test-coverage-reporting/">Real-Time Continuous Test Coverage Reporting</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Declarative Stubbing" href="http://www.sureassert.com/uc/features/declarative-stubbing/">Declarative Stubbing</a></strong> <em>of Classes, Methods and Individual Code Statements</em></li>
<li><strong><a title="Comprehensive JUnit integration" href="http://www.sureassert.com/uc/features/comprehensive-junit-integration/">Comprehensive JUnit integration</a></strong></li>
</ul><p>Our driving principal is to provide the tooling required to maximize the benefits of both <em>Contract-First Design </em>and<em> Test Driven Development</em><em></em>.  Sureassert UC amalgamates these concepts by treating unit tests as part of the declared contract of every method and running them automatically.  Sureassert Exemplars offer <em>true</em> unit testing capability by isolating the functionality of a single method and enforcing its contract.  <em></em>The tool also provides integration with JUnit, allowing bespoke (coded) tests to be run within the Sureassert testing context; leveraging the tool's stubbing, coverage reporting and automated execution capabilities.</p>
<p>Sureassert UC is unique in providing these features with <em>no coding required: </em> no API, configuration files or scripts.  The UC engine generates and executes tests and stubbed code based on the suite of class, method and field-level annotations provided by the tool.  It does this totally automatically by plugging into the Eclipse incremental build process.</p>
<p>Software constructed using Sureassert UC benefits from:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Increased quality</strong> driven by facilitating a more methodical contract-first approach, and enforcement of contracts and coverage thresholds during development, in real-time</li>
<li><strong>Reduced time to market </strong>resulting from less time writing test code, integrated stubbing and reduced overhead of <em>design for testability</em></li>
<li><strong>Simplification</strong><em> </em>– no configuration files, APIs or test classes... using Sureassert UC is easy!</li>
</ul><p>The Sureassert UC Eclipse Engine is available feature-complete for free download and is compatible with Eclipse versions 3.4 and above.</p>
<p>It is <strong>totally free of charge</strong> for developing your personal or commercial applications.</p>
