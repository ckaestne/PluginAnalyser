      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>Squish is the leading automated GUI Testing tool for Eclipse/RCP and AWT/Swing based applications. Squish is fully integrated into the Eclipse environment.</p>
<p>Squish works natively on Windows, Linux/Unix and Mac OS X and  offers a versatile testing framework for GUI applications with a choice of popular test scripting languages (Python, JavaScript, Perl, and Tcl), extended by Squish's own library of test-specific functions. Squish also provides open interfaces, several add-ons, integration with a variety of test management tools, a powerful IDE supporting the creation and debugging of tests, and a complete set of command line tools that support fully automated test runs.</p>
<p>Squish is also ideal for use in organizations where a variety of GUI technologies are used, since in addition to Java SWT and<br />
AWT/Swing, it also supports the automated testing of applications based on other GUI technologies, including Nokia's Qt,<br />
Web/DOM/HTML/AJAX, native Windopws (MFC and .NET), Mac OS X Carbon/Cocoa, and others.</p>
