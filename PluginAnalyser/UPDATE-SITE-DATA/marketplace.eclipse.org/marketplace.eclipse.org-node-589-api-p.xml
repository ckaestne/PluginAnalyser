      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>JCrypTool is the Java and Eclipse Rich Client Platform based cryptography e-learning platform. Developed as an open-source project, it enables students, teachers, developers, and anyone else interested in cryptography to apply and analyze cryptographic algorithms in a modern, easy-to-use application. Its aim is to create a new form of e-learning by not just encouraging users to learn about cryptography and apply the algorithms themselves, but also to develop their own cryptographic plug-ins and extend the JCrypTool platform in new directions. JCrypTool already includes a wealth of cryptographic mechanisms including classic, symmetric, and asymmetric encryption, hash functions, analysis tools, visualizations and crypto games.</p>
<!--break--><p>JCrypTool is bundled with the advanced cryptographic libraries BouncyCastle and FlexiProvider; other libraries can be easily added to the project. FlexiProvider is the initial default provider, but users can freely change to a different default provider. A fall-through functionality searches top-down for an implementation of any given cryptographic algorithm so that even a specialized provider with only a small subset of algorithms can be selected as the default.</p>
<p>Visit the JCrypTool Core Project on GitHub for the source code (available via Git), developer documentation, wiki and further information about the project. For our cryptographic plug-ins visit the JCrypTool Crypto Project. Our wiki is a good place for new developers to get started and to find additional information, such as our release schedule and a huge list of project ideas.</p>
