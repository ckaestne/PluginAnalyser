Xpeaker is a free and open source solution based on the Xpeak standard (<a href="<a href="http://www.xpeak.org">www.xpeak.org</a>">http://www.xpeak.org">www.xpeak.org</a></a>). The product is largely comprised of three<br />
elements, including the source code for each one.<br />
</p><br />
<ul><br />
  <li><b>Xpeaker IDE</b></li><br />
</ul><br />
<p><br />
An Eclipse plug-in with test functions, configuration, code-sharing, print form editor, traces viewer, deployment and software update.<br />
</p><br />
<ul><br />
  <li><b>Xpeaker Services</b></li><br />
</ul><br />
<p><br />
A set of device drivers which follow the standard Xpeak and also includes simulators.<br />
</p><br />
<ul><br />
  <li><b>Xpeaking</b></li><br />
</ul><br />
<p><br />
Middleware for the quick and easy development of Xpeak applications.<br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
Xpeaker is commercialized under a dual license. Those clients who do not require the maintenance services may use the Xpeaker complete<br />
solution totally free of charge. If the contrary applies, they should obtain an EC (End Customer) commercial Xpeaker license.<br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
In the same way and irrespective of whether they are hardware or software dedicated, all businesses that wish to create their own products based<br />
around Xpeaker may do so free of charge or by acquiring the corresponding commercial license (Xpeaker HW or Xpeaker SW), depending<br />
on what the intended use of the resulting product is.<br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
The terms and conditions for the use of the Xpeaker product are governed by the <b>Xpeaker Public License</b>.<br />
