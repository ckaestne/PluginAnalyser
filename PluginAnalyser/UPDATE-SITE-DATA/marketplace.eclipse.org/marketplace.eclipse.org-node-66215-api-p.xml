      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>If you are using the <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jubula-automated-functional-testing-feature">Jubula feature</a> within Eclipse or are are working with the "Eclipse for Testers" package you have to install this feature to make additional database drivers and configuration settings available.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard H2 embedded database you can use Oracle, MySQL and Postgres with this feature.</p>
<p>Please be aware that BREDEX tests Jubula and GUIdancer with Oracle. The drivers for MySQL and Postgres are added with the status 'unsupported'. We have performed a basic test with Jubula and GUIdancer against these databases and know that there are customers that use them, but we do not include them in our regression tests.</p>
