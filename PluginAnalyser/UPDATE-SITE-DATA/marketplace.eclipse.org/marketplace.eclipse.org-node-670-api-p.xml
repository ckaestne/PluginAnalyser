      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>ProjectKoach brings your whole agile process into Eclipse and gives you a wealth of powerful features to help you take your agile projects from start to finish without ever leaving your workspace.<br />
Centered around a free-form, file-based requirements backlog and a visual iteration plan editor, ProjectKoach features complete support for, amongst other, the popular Scrum method, including point estimation, repeatable process patterns, and built-in progress charts that allow you to gauge your team’s productivity with burn-up, burn-down and velocity charts.<br />
Integrated with Mylyn, you can import your team’s defects from your external bug tracker right into your iteration plans, so you can plan those together with your other backlog items.<br />
Your project environment can include any mix of free basic and license-based Premium ProjectKoach installations for optimal team performance at the lowest possible cost.<br />
ProjectKoach is available both as Eclipse plug-in and RCP application for all major platforms.</p>
