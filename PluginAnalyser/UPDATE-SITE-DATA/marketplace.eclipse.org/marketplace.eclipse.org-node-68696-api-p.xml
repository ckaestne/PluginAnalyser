      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>Part of my day I'm working on some cool OSGi server stuff. While doing this I came across a few issues with PDE. Mostly they are around launching and self-hosting. PDE Plus is a patch for PDE that addresses a few.</p>
<p>As with all my Open Source engagements, I just don't stop after reporting issues. I also take the time to analyze them and provide patches. Why? Well, it saves me a lot of time in the end because I don't need to live with workarounds. :)</p>
<p>Here is a list of patches produced so far for Eclipse PDE 3.7.0 and included:</p>
<ul><li><a>Bug 326059</a> - [launch] [patch] Add Eclipse Product launch configuration type for true product configuration launches</li>
<li><a>Bug 315061</a> - [patch] Should read start levels from bundles.info of target platform when launching Eclipse application</li>
<li><a>Bug 315039</a> - [patch] Eclipse launch configuration should inherit properties from target platform</li>
<li><a>Bug 314619</a> - [patch] org.eclipse.equinox.app is not started when using Eclipse Application launcher</li>
</ul><p>Now, thanks to Eclipse it's also possible to easily share these patches with you.</p>
