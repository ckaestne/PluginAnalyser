      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<h2>MARBLE™</h2>
<p>MARBLE™ (Modernization Approach for Recovering Business processes  from LEgacy Systems) is a framework that focuses on the reverse engineering stage in the  horseshoe modernization model to obtain business processes from legacy  information systems. <a href="http://www.omg.org/technology/kdm/index.htm">KDM</a> is the core of MARBLE™, since it enables the representation and management of  knowledge extracted by means of reverse engineering from all the different  software artifacts of the legacy system in an integrated way. Then, that legacy  knowledge is gradually transformed into business processes. For this purpose,  MARBLE™ is divided into four abstraction levels with three transformations among  them.<br /></p>
<h2><a href="http://www.businessprocessarcheology.org/downloads/MARBLE.rar" alt="MARBLE download">Download</a></h2>

<p><img src="http://www.businessprocessarcheology.org/images/MARBLE.png" alt="MARBLE" width="450" /></p><ul><li><strong>Level L0</strong>. This level represents the  legacy information system in the real world, and is the source system to  recover underlying business processes.</li>
<li><strong>Level L1</strong>.<strong> </strong>This level represents several specific models, i.e., one model for  each different software artifact involved in the <a href="http://www.businessprocessarcheology.org/" alt="Business Process Archeology">archeology</a> process like source  code, database, user interface, and so on. These models are considered PSM  models since they depict the software artifacts according to their specific  technology platforms.<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Level L2</strong>. This level consists of a  single PIM model that represents the integrated view of the set of PSM models  in L1. The KDM metamodel is used for this purpose, since it makes it possible  to model all the artifacts of the legacy system in an integrated and technological-independent  manner. Firstly, we say that L2 is obtained in an integrated way because L2  works as a KDM repository that can be progressively populated with knowledge  extracted from the different information systems of an organization. This is  due to the fact that the <em>structure</em> package at the last KDM abstraction layer (c.f. Section 2.2) allows representing different systems, subsystems, components,  architecture view, and so on. This is a key advantage because business  processes are usually executed by multiple systems within an organization.  Secondly, we say that L2 is represented in a technological-independent way due  to the fact that KDM standard abstract (from the program element layer, the  second layer of the KDM metamodel) all those details concerning the  technological viewpoint (e.g. the program language). Thereby, the KDM  repository at L2 can represent several legacy information systems even when  their program languages or platforms are different. </li>
<li><strong>Level L3</strong>. This level depicts, at the end  of the <a href="http://www.businessprocessarcheology.org/" alt="Business Process Archeology">archeology process</a>, the business processes recovered from the legacy  system that is fully represented by a KDM model in L2. The business process  model in L3 represents a CIM model of the system.</li>
</ul><p>The three generic transformations between  the four abstraction levels proposed in MARBLE™ are the following:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Transformation L0-to-L1</strong>. This  transformation obtains PSM models from each legacy software artifact. Classical  reverse engineering techniques such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, program slicing and  dicing, formal concept analysis, subsystem decomposition, and so on, could be  used to extract the knowledge from any software artifact and build the PSM  model related to it. These PSM models are represented according to specific  metamodels. For example, a Java metamodel may be used to model the legacy  source code, or an SQL metamodel to represent the database schema, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation L1-to-L2</strong>. The  transformation between levels L1 and L2 consists of a set of model  transformations to obtain a PIM model based on the KDM metamodel. This PIM  model is built from the PSM models from level L1. The L1-to-L2 transformation  can be implemented by means of QVT. The transformation from the legacy  information system (L0) to the KDM model (L2) is not direct due to the fact  that, in many cases, the platform-specific knowledge in the intermediate level  L1 might be used to infer more business knowledge. Thus, the semantic gap  between the legacy system and its KDM model is reduced incrementally through  L1. <strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Transformation L2-to-L3</strong>. This  transformation is based on a set of patterns. When a specific structure is detected  in the KDM model from level L2, each pattern indicates what elements should be  built and how they are interrelated in the business process model in L3. This  is known as pattern matching and can be implemented in MARBLE™ by means of QVT relations, the declarative part of the QVT language. In addition, this last  transformation can be assisted by business experts who know the organization.  The external information provided by experts also serves as valuable knowledge in <a href="http://www.businessprocessarcheology.org/" alt="Business Process Archeology">business process archeology</a>. Experts can determine inconsistent or incoherent  fragments in the preliminary business process models obtained after pattern  matching; they can refactor the business process models, and incrementally fit  the process models to the real behavior of the organization. Moreover, this  transformation supports the representation of several subsystems at the same  time. This transformation structures subsystems as different pools and lanes in  the process model. Lanes and pools, which represent  <a href="http://www.bpmn.org/">BPMN</a> sub-modules, are related between them by means of certain data objects. These data objects are written by a sub-module and are read by  another sub-module (e.g. data stored in a database by a subsystem and loaded by  other subsystem; or a subsystem invoking a service of another one). Moreover, not  all parts of business processes are executed by legacy information systems,  i.e., there are a lot of manual business activities. Manual business activities  can be also added by final business expert intervention. Since we are proposing  an automated approach, the treatment of that kind of activities is beyond of  the scope of this work. Other techniques address  challenges like identifying human activities in the legacy system, activities  outside the legacy system, identifying roles, and so on.<br /></li>
</ul><p>	The main objective of MARBLE™ is to  provide a first version of business process models that, compared with business  process redesign by business experts from scratch, represents a more efficient  solution and a good start point to achieve <a href="http://www.businessprocessarcheology.org/" alt="Business Process Archeology">business process archeology</a>. In  addition, the business process redesign by experts from scratch might discard  meaningful business knowledge that is only present in legacy information  systems. Anyway, MARBLE™ supports the addition and integration of manual  business activities together the discovered business processes. For this  purpose, MARBLE™ defines a finite set of operations that business experts can  carry out in the business processes at the end of the automate part of our method.<br /></p>
<p>MARBLE™ is defined as a  generic framework to rebuild business processes because it defines the  organization of the four abstraction levels as well as the guidelines to  perform the three transformations between them. However, this generic framework  must be instantiated for each kind of program language on which the system is  based, for each reverse engineering technique that is considered to extract the  legacy knowledge, and so forth. The following subsections depict the three  specific transformations that show how the <a href="http://www.businessprocessarcheology.org/" alt="Business Process Archeology">business process archeology</a> is  carried out.</p>
