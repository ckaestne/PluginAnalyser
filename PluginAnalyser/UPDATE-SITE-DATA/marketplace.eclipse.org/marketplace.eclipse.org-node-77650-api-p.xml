      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>"Find it EZ Code Search adds full 360 degree application source dependency scanning.  You can now search beyond the scope of your projects from within the Eclipse IDE.  In-file text is easily queried using the context-sensitive menu in the Eclipse editor, which launches a Find it EZ interface, complete with search options and filters.  Either highlight the desired search term or place the cursor near a word you wish to search, Right-click anywhere in the editor, and click "Find it EZ" to instantly query the code to be searched.  Generalized searches can also be launched through the Eclipse Edit menu, by selecting "Find it EZ".</p>
