      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>The "default" bookmark methods of Eclipse ask for a name and this is often not very useful. The code here adds bookmarks a la "Borland" and bookmarks a la "JCreator". The code has the following options which can all be bound/rebound with the keys dialog under the "Edit" category:</p>
<p>* Add a numbered bookmark at the cursor: Alt+[digit]. This creates a quick bookmark with the specified number using a "single" keypress. Only one bookmark of the given number can be present in the workspace. Setting the same number bookmark again will clear the earlier instance.</p>
<p>* Goto a numbered bookmark: Alt+Shift+[digit]. Moves to the bookmark as it was set using Alt+[digit].<br />
* Toggle Bookmark: Ctrl+B. This drops an unnamed bookmark at the current location. Pressing Ctrl+B again releases the bookmark at that location again. This is often used with "Goto next bookmark" and "Goto previous bookmark".</p>
<p>* Goto next bookmark in file: Ctrl+N. This locates the next bookmark in the current file and moves there.<br />
* Goto previous bookmark in file: Ctrl+P. This locates the previous bookmark in the current file and moves there.warning: the Ctrl+P binding is a suggestion only; since Ctrl+P is currently assigned you must add your own key binding using Window -> Preferences -> General -> Keys.</p>
