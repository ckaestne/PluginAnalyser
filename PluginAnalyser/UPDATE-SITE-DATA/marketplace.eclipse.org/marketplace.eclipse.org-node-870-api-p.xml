      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>This open source integration enables developers using Eclipse to access the rich features and functionality of the CollabNet TeamForge™ ALM platform and the Subversion software configuration management (SCM) tool from their IDE.   </p>
<p>CollabNet Desktop connects Eclipse and Subversion through Subclipse.   </p>
<p>CollabNet Desktop – Eclipse Edition features substantial ease-of-use innovations and deeper integration between IDEs and the CollabNet products than ever before. This new version of the desktops increase developer productivity with seamless integration and an all-new graphical point-and-click interface.  Associations between pieces of code, or between code and defects are now made with drag-and-drop precision, eliminating the need for error-prone re-typing or cutting and pasting of defect numbers.  Multiple issue and bug trackers are also supported for end-to-end collaboration between developers and testers for defect management.</p>
<p>Distributed ALM from you Desktop</p>
<p>-- Source Code Management: access repositories and perform all Subversion-related activities with support of  a powerful interface for merge tracking, graphical conflict resolution, and tree conflict handling.<br />
--  Requirements, Issue Tracking, Project Management, Collaboration: easily open requirements documents, link code changes to issues, manage timelines, and search discussion forums and wikis across projects.<br />
--  Continuous Build & Test Integration: set the rules that drive build behavior and alerts. Access issues logged automatically to your issue tracking system for unsuccessful builds or manage file releases from successful builds.<br />
-- Lab Management: dynamically provision build and test servers right from your IDE using a graphical interface.  Manage resources in a private or a public cloud.</p>
<p>Need a Subversion server, too? Checkout <a href="http://www.open.collab.net/downloads/subversion?cid=empcd">CollabNet Subversion Edge</a></p>
