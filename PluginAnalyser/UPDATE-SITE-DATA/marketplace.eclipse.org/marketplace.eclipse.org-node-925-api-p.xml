      <shortdescription><![CDATA[<p>KoutraXform is an application that allows the transformation of any kind of data to any other kind of data. It is also a framework for providing the building blocks that allow such transformations.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish its aim, KoutraXform Designer is an Eclipse plug-in and GEF based application that allows the user to design a pipeline that describes the transformation. The user does this by graphically building up a pipeline consisting of the building blocks supplied by the KoutraXform runtime. The user can then run the pipeline that they have build up through the UI locally, or on a cluster of cooperating KoutraXform nodes.</p>
