PluginAnalyser
==============


PluginAnalyser is a  **research project**  that aims at building a plugin analysis system that lets you determing external, unstated and unwanted dependencies for  an eclipse plugin as well as  that of a combination of plugins 

PluginAnalyser allows you to setup, mirror, analyse and record and compare to figure out missing and unstated dependencies from information of, feature(s), plugin(s) or a set of those, as well as complete installations and update sites  in the  Eclipse ecosystem 

**This is still work in progress.**
